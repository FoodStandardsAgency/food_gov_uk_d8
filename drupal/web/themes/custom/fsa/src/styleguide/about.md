This style guide is intended to assist front-end developers and designers who work on food.gov.uk in the future. It aims to provide introductory information around the three following areas:

- The front-end structure and tooling used throughout the site
- The coding style and approaches to development
- Visual examples of the components and colours used

Many of the components have been built in isolation, with CSS and JS tightly coupled with the HTML. Where this is the case, you can see the corresponding CSS and JS for that component by clicking on the respective tab. Where this is not available in this document, it can be found by searching for the related classes and IDs throughout the codebase.
