ratings_info_content: "<h2>What are the hygiene ratings?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Food hygiene ratings help you to choose where to eat out or shop for food by telling you how seriously the business takes their food hygiene standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ratings are given by local authorities in England, Northern Ireland and Wales and they apply to restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, supermarkets and other food shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The food hygiene rating reflects the hygiene standards found at the time the business is inspected by a food safety officer. These officers are specially trained to assess food hygiene standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>These are the three elements that a food hygiene rating is based on</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored</li>\r\n\t<li>the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities</li>\r\n\t<li>how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the top rating of ‘5’, businesses must do well in all three elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those with ratings of ‘0’ are very likely to be performing poorly in all three elements and are likely to have a history of serious problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://local.food.gov.uk/ratings/search#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about food hygiene ratings</a></p>\r\n"
