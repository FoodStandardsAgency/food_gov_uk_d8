ratings_info_content: "<h2>What are the hygiene ratings?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The food hygiene rating scheme helps you choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving you clear information about the businesses’ hygiene standards. &nbsp;The scheme gives businesses a rating which is displayed at their premises or online so you can make more informed choices about where to buy and eat food. We are the government department responsible for food safety in the United Kingdom – we run the scheme in partnership with local authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scheme is set out in law in Wales and Northern Ireland but is voluntary in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-embed-button=\"image\" data-entity-embed-display=\"entity_reference:media_thumbnail\" data-entity-embed-display-settings=\"{&quot;image_style&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;image_link&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"4f715727-e224-42b7-be8c-a6b66d4f9933\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ratings give a&nbsp;snapshot&nbsp;of the&nbsp;food hygiene standards found at the time of inspection.
