ratings_info_content: "<h2>What are the hygiene ratings?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The scheme gives businesses a rating which is displayed in shop windows or online so you can make more informed choices about where to buy and eat food. We are a government department responsible for food safety in the United Kingdom – we run the scheme in partnership with local authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We give local authorities advice, training and support to help them run the scheme. The scheme is set out in law in Wales and Northern Ireland but is voluntary in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{\"preview_thumbnail\":\"/sites/default/files/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/GBhp0iBy4oo.jpg?itok=YBDMct2b\",\"video_url\":\"https://youtu.be/GBhp0iBy4oo?list=PLLjuAI9EppAEQFoFDHqnYqrZPVbGXf-In\",\"settings\":{\"responsive\":1,\"width\":\"854\",\"height\":\"480\",\"autoplay\":0},\"settings_summary\":[\"Embedded Video (Responsive).\"]}</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ratings show how food, hygiene and safety is managed by the business at the time of inspection.
