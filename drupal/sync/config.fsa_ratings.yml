ratings_info_content: "<h2>What are the hygiene ratings?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The scheme gives businesses a rating which is displayed in shop windows or online so you can make more informed choices about where to buy and eat food. We are a government department responsible for food safety in the United Kingdom – we run the scheme in partnership with local authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We give local authorities advice, training and support to help them run the scheme. The scheme is set out in law in Wales and Northern Ireland but is voluntary in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{\"preview_thumbnail\":\"/sites/default/files/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/GBhp0iBy4oo.jpg?itok=YBDMct2b\",\"video_url\":\"https://youtu.be/GBhp0iBy4oo?list=PLLjuAI9EppAEQFoFDHqnYqrZPVbGXf-In\",\"settings\":{\"responsive\":1,\"width\":\"854\",\"height\":\"480\",\"autoplay\":0},\"settings_summary\":[\"Embedded Video (Responsive).\"]}</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ratings show how food, hygiene and safety is managed by the business at the time of inspection. It is the responsibility of the business to comply with food hygiene law at all times.<br />\r\nThis includes</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>handling of food</li>\r\n\t<li>how food is stored</li>\r\n\t<li>how food is prepared</li>\r\n\t<li>cleanliness of facilities</li>\r\n\t<li>how food safety is managed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The food hygiene rating scheme does not provide information on the following factors</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>quality of the food &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>customer service &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>culinary skill &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>presentation &nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>comfort</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For suspected food poisoning, seek medical advice from your GP and contact your local environmental health or food safety team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we identify increased risks of consuming certain foods such as unpasteurised milk, cheese or less than thoroughly cooked burgers – a food hygiene rating does not reflect if these risks have been eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, the young, elderly and those who have an impaired immune system or a food allergy, should check directly with the business, if ordering high risk foods, at the point of sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Understanding ratings</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The rating shows how well the business is doing overall and considers any necessary improvements and the level of risk to people’s health that these issues pose. The ratings can be found online and on stickers which are displayed at business premises. The stickers and the online rating will also show the date the hygiene standards were assessed by the local authority’s food safety officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{\"preview_thumbnail\":\"/sites/default/files/styles/video_embed_wysiwyg_preview/public/video_thumbnails/P5b2h05oP2E.jpg?itok=vKNtMr8f\",\"video_url\":\"https://youtu.be/P5b2h05oP2E?list=PLLjuAI9EppAEQFoFDHqnYqrZPVbGXf-In\",\"settings\":{\"responsive\":1,\"width\":\"854\",\"height\":\"480\",\"autoplay\":0},\"settings_summary\":[\"Embedded Video (Responsive).\"]}</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ratings are typically given to places where food is supplied, sold or consumed, such as</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>restaurants, pubs and cafes</li>\r\n\t<li>takeaways, food vans and stalls</li>\r\n\t<li>canteens and hotels</li>\r\n\t<li>supermarkets and other food shops</li>\r\n\t<li>schools, hospitals and care homes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A food safety officer from the local authority inspects a business to check that it follows food hygiene law so that the food is safe to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the inspection, the officer will check the following three elements&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored</li>\r\n\t<li>the physical condition of the business –including cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation, pest control and other facilities</li>\r\n\t<li>how the business manages ways of keeping food safe, looking at processes, training and systems to ensure good hygiene is maintained. The officer can then assess the level of confidence in standards being maintained in the future</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>The rating scale</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>5 is top of the scale, this means the hygiene standards are very good</li>\r\n\t<li>0 is at the bottom of the scale, this means urgent improvement necessary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To get the top rating, businesses must do well in all three elements which are referenced above. If the top rating is not given, the officer will explain to the business the necessary actions they can take to improve their hygiene rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A breakdown of the three elements making up the food hygiene rating for business is also provided with the online rating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detailed information is included in the food safety officer’s inspection report. If you want to see this you could make a Freedom of Information request to the local authority that carried out the inspection. You can find the local authority’s contact details by searching this website for the business and then clicking on the name of the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can report a food problem to the local food safety team responsible for inspecting the business. The local authority will consider your request and will usually send you a copy of the report. In some cases, the local authority may decide that they cannot do so but will let you know this and explain why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since April 2016, a breakdown of the three elements making up the food hygiene rating for business in England and Northern Ireland is also published. This additional information has been available for businesses in Wales inspected since November 2014 under the statutory scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more information on <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"df25ad6b-f0b4-46e8-b724-323cf0bed2b0\" href=\"/node/165\">how to find a rating</a> and safeguard information for businesses.</p>\r\n"
