# Workflows

## Editoral workflow

Two roles are pertinent to the editorial workflow:_author_ and _editor_.

An _author_ may create a new draft of the following content types:

- consultations
- pages
- research reports

They may not publish the above content, but when they are satisfied with their initial draft they can mark it as _ready to review_. If they change their mind they may move it back into draft, however, be aware that when an author marks content as _ready to review_ an email alert to all editors is triggered. 

Once published an _author_ may still move content back into draft to revise it. The initial, now published, revision will stay live while the new revision is worked on. Only after the revision has been moved, again, into _ready to review_ and then _published_ will the new revision go live.

It is only an _editor_ who may publish and archive content. In most cases it will be appropriate to give a user, who has the _editor_ role, the _author_ role also, so that they can intervene at any stage of the workflow.
