# Workflows

## Editoral

Two roles are pertinent to the editorial workflow:
1. **_Author_**
2. **_Editor_**

An _author_ may view published content, create new content, and view or edit any unpublished content. They may also translate content. When they are satisfied, they may move their content from a _draft_ state into a _drafted_ state. They may, also, move their content back into a _draft_ state if, for example, they notice a mistake in what they have authored. Authors can, also, edit each others content.

**Author: Draft <-> Drafted**

An _editor_ can perform most operations on content. The editor can move content  into a _published_ state, at which point its status will automatically change to published. The content can, now, be viewed by all visitors to the site, and indexed by search engines. They can also move the content, or content translation, back into a _draft_ state, if they feel it requires more work.

**Editor: Draft <- Drafted -> Published**

Alternatively, after publication, content can be put into an _archived_ state, if it is no longer needed. It will automatically be unpublished. It can be restored to either a _published_ or _draft_ state. This can be useful for seasonal content, which is re-purposed year after year.

**Editor: Published / Draft <-> Archived**
