# Food Standards Agency

Welcome to the repository of the *FSA* project. Thank you for choosing to work on this project.

## Prerequisites.

You'll need to be running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the [Deeson Docker Proxy](https://github.com/teamdeeson/docker-proxy) to run this project locally.

## Getting started.

1. Clone the repo.
2. `make install`
3. `make start`
4. Add a database dump e.g. 

```
drush @test sql-dump > test.sql
pv test.sql | docker-compose exec -T mariadb mysql -udrupal -pdrupal drupal
```

6. Prepare the database for local usage `make update`
5. Login for the first time `drush @docker uli`

## Subsequent runs.

1. Start Docker: `make start`
2. Login: `drush @docker uli`

## When done.

Stop Docker to save resources: `make stop`

## Updating this project.

This project uses [Drush Make](https://docs.drush.org/en/7.x/make/) for pulling in dependencies.

### Updating modules.

Follow the normal advice on `https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/update/update-modules`

However, we want to run the composer command inside a docker container so use the following Make command. Note that you 
will be prompted for the module name after running the make command, it does not need to be part of the Make command

`make drupal-update-module`

### Updating core.

No special considerations for this project.  Just do it with the Make command below to make sure it happens 
inside a docker container.

`make drupal-upgrade`

### Adding a new module.

Modules are added with a Make command. This uses composer inside a docker container for you.  There's no arguments on a 
Make command, it will prompt you for the module name, e.g. to instal drupal/warden just type `warden` when asked. 

`make drupal-add-module`

## Patching the project.

Patches should be referenced from Drupal.org where possible. If you must make a patch file store it in the patches directory in the project root.

Patches are then referenced in the `composer.json` file as in the extras -> patches section.

```
        "patches": {
            "drupal/core": {
                "Human readable issue descriptiobn": "https://www.drupal.org/files/uri-of-patch-file.patch",
                ...
```

## Branching strategy.

We use [GitFlow](https://www.deeson.co.uk/labs/using-git-flow-drupal-project) branching strategy on this project.

You can merge into the UAT branch without a pull request to deploy your work to the dev site. 
Don't finish the feature branch when you do this - feature branches are only finished when they have passed inspection
on UAT and have at least one approved pull request and then merged into develop ready for the next release.

## Hosting.

This project is hosted on **Acquia**.

## Deployment.

The `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file describes the build process which is execute on commit to specified branches in BitBucket.

You must create a tag release before release.  The production environment should be tracking the latest tag release.
Tag releases must only be cut from the master branch.

## Environmental configuration management.

This project uses:

* Drupal 8's configuration management for exporting database artifacts to code.
* An organised approach to [settings.php environmental variables](https://www.deeson.co.uk/labs/site-configuration-strategy-or-how-manage-your-settingsphp-files) via the `src/settings` directory.
* Secure environment settings should not be in version control and managed via the hosting environment variables.

## Jira project management.

Tickets are managed in this [Jira project](https://deeson.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=332&projectKey=FSA)

## Site environments

- Production [www.food.gov.uk](https://www.food.gov.uk)
  - Acquia Cloud domain: [http://foodgovuk.prod.acquia-sites.com](http://foodgovuk.prod.acquia-sites.com)
- Staging [http://fsauser:FCeDh4u&7n2p@foodgovukstg.prod.acquia-sites.com](http://foodgovukstg.prod.acquia-sites.com)
- Dev: [http://fsauser:FCeDh4u&7n2p@foodgovukdev.prod.acquia-sites.com](http://foodgovukdev.prod.acquia-sites.com)

## FHRS Rating Search

FHRS Establishment and authority data is pulled from [FHRS rating API](http://api.ratings.food.gov.uk) with Drupal Migrate API.

- Refer to [fsa_ratings/README.md](/docroot/modules/custom/fsa_ratings/README.md) for entity documentation.
- Refer to [fsa_ratings_import/README.md](/docroot/modules/custom/fsa_ratings_import/README.md) for import documentation.

## FSA Alerts API

[Alert API documentation](http://fsa-staging-alerts.epimorphics.net/food-alerts/ui/reference)

Alert API data is imported to Drupal `alerts_allergen` taxonomy and `alert` nodes.

- Refer to [fsa_alerts/README.md](/docroot/modules/custom/fsa_alerts/README.md) for documentation.

## FSA Ratings search / Elasticsearch

- Ratings search is located at `/ratings/search`.
- The rating search is implemented with `fsa_ratings` module.
- FSA Establishments are indexed to Elasticsearch with FSA Elasticsearch integration (`fsa_es`) module, refer to [README.md](/drupal/web/modules/custom/fsa_es/README.md) for documentation.

##Â SMTP services

The site uses Office 365 SMTP services on the production environment. The smtp Drupal contrib module provides the interception/rerouting of messages from the applictation.

Dummy configuration is stored in the `config/default` folder to avoid storing SMTP credentials in VCS.

The specific variable values for host, username, password etc are managed through environmental variables. These are defined as key/pair values in the Acquia control panel (specific per environment) or can be defined in the `.ddev/docker-compose.override.yaml` file for local debugging.

**Values that contain a `$` character need a preceeding `\` escape character in Acquia, and docker-composer expects double-dollar `$$` to prevent variable substitution taking place.**

> **Never store these - or other sensitive - values in the repository in a .env file, config export or otherwise. They could result in the SMTP service being used to handle or deliver spam**
